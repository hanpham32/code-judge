1. Project Setup

   Step: Initialize a new Rust project using Cargo.
   Checkpoint:
   Run cargo new code-judge and verify the project directory is created with Cargo.toml and src folder.
   Add the project to a version control system (e.g., Git) for tracking progress.
   Verify the basic "Hello, World!" program compiles and runs with cargo run.

2. Add Dependencies

   Step: Add necessary dependencies to Cargo.toml for CLI parsing, file traversal, and other functionalities.
   Example dependencies:
   clap (for CLI parsing)
   walkingdir (for directory traversal)
   serde (for configuration handling)
   anyhow (for error handling)
   Checkpoint:
   Verify that cargo build succeeds without errors after adding dependencies.
   Write a simple test function to ensure all dependencies are correctly imported.

3. Code Analysis Implementation

   Step: Create logic to analyze code files and directories.
   Start with basic functionality:
   Traverse a directory recursively.
   Process all files of a specific language (e.g., Rust).
   Identify basic issues (e.g., long lines, formatting violations).
   Checkpoint:
   Create a test file (test_code.rs) with intentional issues (e.g., long lines, duplicate code).
   Run the analysis logic and verify that it detects the issues.
   Output the results to the console to confirm the feedback is generated.

4. Diff Generation

   Step: Implement a system to generate unified diffs (like Git diffs) for code suggestions.
   Use an existing crate (e.g., diff or text_diff) to generate diffs.
   Write the generated diffs to a temporary file.
   Checkpoint:
   Create a test file and modify it to generate a diff.
   Open the temporary diff file and verify it matches the expected format.
   Use a diff viewer (e.g., diff-so-fancy) to visually confirm the diffs are correct.

5. Neovim Integration

   Step: Add functionality to launch Neovim in the terminal and display the diffs.
   Use std::process::Command to execute Neovim with the diff file.
   Configure Neovim to open the diff in a split view (e.g., using vimdiff or similar commands).
   Checkpoint:
   Create a sample diff file and write a test function to launch Neovim.
   Verify that Neovim opens the diff file in the expected layout (e.g., side-by-side comparison).
   Confirm that the user can interact with Neovim (e.g., navigate and edit).

6. Configuration Handling

   Step: Implement a configuration file (e.g., config.toml) to store settings like ignored files, enabled rules, and Neovim preferences.
   Use serde for parsing and serialization of the config file.
   Checkpoint:
   Create a sample config.toml file with test settings.
   Write a test function to parse the config file and verify the settings are loaded correctly.
   Modify the config file and confirm the changes are reflected in the application.

7. CLI Implementation

   Step: Create a command-line interface with subcommands for analyze and view.
   Use clap to define the CLI structure.
   Checkpoint:
   Run cargo run -- --help and verify the CLI usage instructions are displayed.
   Test the analyze command with a sample file or directory and confirm feedback is generated.
   Test the view command to ensure Neovim opens with the generated diffs.

8. Testing

   Step: Write comprehensive tests for all components:
   Unit tests for individual functions (e.g., code analysis, diff generation).
   Integration tests for end-to-end functionality (e.g., analyzing a file and opening Neovim).
   Checkpoint:
   Run cargo test and verify all tests pass.
   Add coverage reporting (e.g., using cargo-cov) to ensure all critical code paths are tested.

9. Error Handling and Logging

   Step: Implement robust error handling and logging:
   Use anyhow for error propagation and context.
   Add logging using a crate like tracing or log.
   Checkpoint:
   Intentionally trigger errors (e.g., invalid file paths, missing config files) and verify proper error messages are displayed.
   Enable logging and confirm that logs are generated for both successful and failed operations.

10. Documentation and Packaging

    Step: Write documentation for the project:
    User guide for installation, configuration, and usage.
    API documentation for developers contributing to the project.
    Checkpoint:
    Generate project documentation using cargo doc and verify it is accessible.
    Write a README.md file with installation instructions and examples.
    Package the project as a Cargo crate and verify it can be installed and run by other users.
